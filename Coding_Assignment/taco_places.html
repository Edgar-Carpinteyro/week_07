    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Coming in 3rd place is Clutch Roadhouse. This is the fanciest spot out of the top three locations. If you are looking to spend some time eating and enjoying some beverages on a late afternoon, this is the place for you. The Ajillo Shrimp Taco is to die for, especially when accompanied by an ice-cold margarita. The food is a bit pricey but it will be made with the best ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Tacos Chidos</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">The second place belongs to Tacos Chidos. Strategically located outside of a Whole Foods Market, hungry customers stop by to eat some juicy and delicious street tacos. Loyal customers describe Tacos Chidos as the best place in town and hold "tacos al pastor" with high regard. The food here is delicious and I always see a line every time I pass by. Tacos are $2 each, which is make it an affordable meal for everyone.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Taking the number one spot is El Primo Taco. Besides the delicous tacos that are served here, there are many factors that make this the best taco spot in Venice. Unlike other tacos places, all the ingredients in this place are neatly cut and organized. The tacos are a bit smaller than the usual LA tacos and are more like the tacos in Mexico City, which allow customer to try different tacos options in a single order. Despite being located in Venice, the tacos and aguas frescas are still just $1! That's quite a bargain. To top it off, the staff at El Primo Taco deliver great customer service and always greet you with a smile. If you're ever in Venice, pay this place a visit; you won't regret it!</p>
