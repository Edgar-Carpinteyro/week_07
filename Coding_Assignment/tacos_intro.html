    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Venice Beach is known worldwide for its beachfront, hippie vibes, body building competitions, and skateboarding culture (among other things). One thing it is less well known for is for being a spot with amazing food. Venice is home to a diverse and multicultural population, which means there are tons of great places to eat. From tasty Thai food at Star of Siam to delicious Italian food at C&O Cucina, there is something for everyone. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">When it comes to Mexican food, Venice is not often associated as a primary destination for many Angelenos, especially when it comes to tacos. On my ques to discover the best tacos destinations in LA, I've stumbled upon three locations that serve some of the best tacos in the city.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Let's dive into what makes these places so special.</p>
